# 🎮 Roblox Item Scripts – For Educational Use Only

Welcome to the repo! This project is a creative exploration of scripting in Roblox, designed purely for **educational and sandbox experimentation**. Whether you're learning how game mechanics work or tinkering with Studio environments, these scripts aim to spark curiosity and fun in a responsible way.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

> These scripts are intended **ONLY** for educational use and **should not** be deployed in public games or used to exploit multiplayer experiences. Respect Roblox's terms of service and community guidelines. 💙

## ⚠️ Ethics & Safety

- This is a safe space for **learning**, not cheating.
- Please don’t use these tools in games you don’t own.
- If you experiment outside Roblox Studio, make sure you’re doing so ethically and privately.

## ✨ Goals

- Empower learners and curious scripters
- Explore how items are added and managed in games
- Encourage creativity in custom gameplay environments

## 🧪 Try It In Studio

Want to try it out safely? Open Roblox Studio, create a test place, and run the scripts there! Modify, remix, or reinvent—we welcome all kinds of experimentation when it’s done responsibly.

## 🕊️ Have Fun, Be Kind

Learning’s more fun when it doesn’t hurt anyone. So be cool, stay curious, and have fun with it!
